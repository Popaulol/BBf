# BBf (Better Brainfuck)

BBf is a esoteric Programming Language created in 2022 by Staubfinger aka. Staubcoding aka. Popaulol.
It is meant to be a more powerful version of [brainfuck](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck) with support for arbritary syscalls and more.
Its name is the acronym for `Better Brainfuck`.
It *should* run any valid Brainfuck Program, that doesn't contain any of the characters used by the language for its own pourpuses.

## Instruction Set
**DISCLAIMER: This is by no means final**

The Instruction set is the same as regular brainfuck with a multitude of added features and commands.
In Addition to the standard bf Tape, this language adds 6 registers, ABCDEFG, used for the syscall command and for a bit simpler Storage.
They are named ABCDEFG.

### Functions
Functions are a construct made for code reuse but since this is meant to be an esolang though a not so hard one, functions come with a bit of a caveat.
A Function is a collection of instuctions inside curly braces. Every function gets a numeric ID starting with 0, depending on the order they are defined in.
When local functions are created they will override the ID's starting at 0 again from the outer function scope but you are still able to access functions on the global level using the = and % instructions.
If a empty function {} is written, it will increment the counter of current functions but won't override the function at the current value.
Calling A undefined function should yield a runtime error.

### Syscalls
When the syscall instruction ยง is invoked it will call the syscall with the ID in the A register followed by the Arguments 6 for the registers B through G.
When the syscall expects a pointer to a struct, you can pass the Address of a cell on the Tape, which will then be treated as a pointer. If its meant to be a string it will just read the characters one cell at a time starting from the specified one. If there is an explicit count it will stop there otherwise it will go to the next cell containing 0.
The way structs will be handled will be defined later.

Pull requests and Issues are very appriceated.
But be aware that I might reject a PR for Any Reason, especially if it comes to adding features.
